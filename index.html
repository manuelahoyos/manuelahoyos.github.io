            <p>Data Analyst with a strong background in Biology, Bioinformatics and research. Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Informatics from New York City College of Technology and certificate in Data Analytics from the University of Miami, currently obtaining a master’s degree in Health informatics from the University of Miami. With an interest in analyzing data at the molecular level in biology, as well as community and population levels in healthcare, I decided to improve my skills in programming languages such as Python, including Pandas and Matplotlib, SQL, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, Machine Learning, and data visualization tools such HTML/CSS, Plotly, D3.js and Tableau. My final group project of the Data Analytics bootcamp consisted of analyzing the current COVID-19 data and visualizing trends. From this project, I realized that I wish to continue using my knowledge and background to aid in healthcare analysis at the population level, while mastering my skills along the process. My technical, problem-solving and team player skills, as well as my desire to help the community, allow me to have a unique perspective. This view provides an ability to aid in decision making and identification of opportunities for improvements, to ultimately contribute to the delivery of care for patients. </p>
